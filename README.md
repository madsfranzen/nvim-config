# âš¡ Neovim 0.12+ Config

My somewhat minimal Neovim configuration built around **Neovim 0.12+ (nightly)**.  
It uses the new **native LSP** client and the built-in **`vim.pack`** package manager.

---

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

- Stay close to **Neovim core** â€” use native features whenever possible  
- Keep it **fast and simple**  
- Use Lua for everything  
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers (no `packer`, no `lazy.nvim`)
